# CS 4730 - Spring 2023
## Computer Game Design
Our course is an introductory course in video game design and production. We will focus on both the design and technical aspects of creating a game, from concept inception and prototyping through coding and playtesting.

Upon successful completion of this course, students will:

* Understand the social and ethical context in which video games are developed, marketed, and played;
* Understand the technologies and platforms upon which modern interactive video games are developed;
* Understand the software engineering concepts necessary to develop video games (and other large systems) in a large development group;
* Comprehend the computational theory used in video games design, as well as, to a lesser extent, related fields (artificial intelligence, computer graphics, networks, etc.);
* Understand the theoretical topic of game theory, and how that applies to multi-player games (and, to a lesser extent, artificial intelligence).

## Quick Info

* Meets MWF 10:00 AM in OLS 018
* Attendance _will_ be taken on multiple days, especially lab activity days.
* There will be (on average) one lab day every week and Random Encounters (e.g. short one question quizzes) can occur on any day.
* [Here is an example schedule from a previous semester.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wQwxfKmuzyVG04oP-hLRcPhZ4eOfXqItqsI-94WnGEM/edit?usp=sharing).  Except for the fact that this was a semester I used Unity, most of the lecture content, order, etc. will be roughly similar.
* You will need to play 2 or 3 required games (_A Short Hike_ will be one of them) and at least one game of your own choosing.
* Students will write multiple 2-3 page papers analyzing these games.
* There will be a semester-long game project where teams of 3-4 students build games using MonoGame.
* Why are we not using Unity?  1. The learning curve for Unity and 2. Unity hides a lot of the interesting game engine things that I want students to learn, such as the game loop

## Required Games

These games *must* be played for class, as you will be analyzing them for papers you will write in the class.

* _A Short Hike_ by adamgryu - Available at https://adamgryu.itch.io/a-short-hike, Steam, Switch, and other major consoles (you will need to complete this game, but it only takes a few hours and is not skill intensive)
* _Celeste_ by Maddy Makes Games - Available at https://mattmakesgames.itch.io/celeste, Steam, Switch and other major consoles (you will *not* need to fully complete this game, but you will need to get a few levels in)

You will also play a game of your own choosing.

## Required Reading

* Game Design Workshop: A Playcentric Approach to Creating Innovative Games by Tracy Fullerton - Available online as a PDF through UVA Library for free
* Reality Is Broken: Why Games Make Us Better and How They Can Change the World by Jane McGonigal - [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Reality-Broken-Games-Better-Change/dp/0143120611)    

I would *highly* suggest reading *Reality is Broken* over winter break, but it's not required to do so.
