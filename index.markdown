# CS 4730 - Spring 2023

## Computer Game Design
Our course is an introductory course in video game design and production. We will focus on both the design and technical aspects of creating a game, from concept inception and prototyping through coding and playtesting.

## Twitch Channel

Throughout the semester, Profs. McBurney and Sherriff will be streaming some games on [Twitch]({{ site.data.externallinks.twitch }}){: .btn  .btn-primary .mr-2 }
under the name GamesAtUVA. We will try to play an eclectic set of games, everything from AAA to indie to board games. We are still in the early
stages of planning this, and this won't be required, but it can be an additional opportunity for us to explore design aspects of real games that
are on the market.

Current plan is to stream Tuesday/Thursday evenings, but this is very subject to change.
