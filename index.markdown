# CS 4730 - Spring 2023
## Computer Game Design
Our course is an introductory course in video game design and production. We will focus on both the design and technical aspects of creating a game, from concept inception and prototyping through coding and playtesting.

Upon successful completion of this course, students will:

* Understand the social and ethical context in which video games are developed, marketed, and played;
* Understand the technologies and platforms upon which modern interactive video games are developed;
* Understand the software engineering concepts necessary to develop video games (and other large systems) in a large development group;
* Comprehend the computational theory used in video games design, as well as, to a lesser extent, related fields (artificial intelligence, computer graphics, networks, etc.);
* Understand the theoretical topic of game theory, and how that applies to multi-player games (and, to a lesser extent, artificial intelligence).

## Quick Info for Registration

* Meets MWF 10:00 AM in OLS 018
* Attendance _will_ be taken on multiple days, especially lab activity days.
* There will be (on average) one lab day every week and Random Encounters (e.g. short one question quizzes) can occur on any day.
* [Here is an example schedule from a previous semester.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wQwxfKmuzyVG04oP-hLRcPhZ4eOfXqItqsI-94WnGEM/edit?usp=sharing).  Except for the fact that this was a semester I used Unity, most of the lecture content, order, etc. will be roughly similar.
* You will need to play 2 or 3 required games (_A Short Hike_ will be one of them) and at least one game of your own choosing.
* Students will write multiple 2-3 page papers analyzing these games.
* There will be a semester-long game project where teams of 3-4 students build games using MonoGame.
* Why are we not using Unity?  1. The learning curve for Unity and 2. Unity hides a lot of the interesting game engine things that I want students to learn, such as the game loop
* There is a book that students will also need to read during the semester - _Reality is Broken_ by Jane McGonigal.  Students signing up for this course are encouraged to read the book over winter break (but it's not required to do so).
