## Physical Prototype Week

Materials can be found in the 2nd cabinet from the left along the wall in Rice 340.  The key is in a lockbox with the "CS 4730" label on it.  The code is posted in Piazza, along with the information below.

Several graduate courses meet in Rice 340, along with faculty talks (basically) every day from 11:00-12:00.  Any other time, you should be able to work in 340.  You are also welcome to take supplies and work elsewhere, such as at home or in our classroom during class time.  PLEASE do not leave with all the tape or glue sticks though, as those are more limited.
